<h1>Welcome! I'm Estefania <br/><a href="https://www.9csound.com/contact-me">Audio Engineer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/e-briones-escalera/">Technical Sound Designer</a> 

<h4>What you'll find here:</h4> This is my curated collection of a series of technical projects and audio systems focused on adaptive audio, trigger logic, real-time feedback, and procedural sound. From sound-driven mechanics to custom analysis tools and experiments in gameplay audio, everything here was designed and implemented by me. Whether you arrived from my demo reel, website, or just stumbled in, thank you for checking out my work! I hope you find something useful, inspiring, or just plain cool. Feel free to explore, and reach out if you‚Äôd like to know more about any of these!

<h4>How to navigate:</h4> Each folder contains a focused audio system or technical feature. A READ ME with summary, features, tech notes, and video links. A code samples or blueprints (when applicable), and NO propietary assets (to keep this repo safe and lean).

<h4>Tech tools I often use:</h4> 
Unreal Engine 5, Wwise, Fmod, Pro Tools, and Logic Pro.

<h4>What am I up to right now?</h4> 
Currently learning C++ and deepening my Blueprint knowledge through structured certifications! I'm also actively working as Technical Sound Designer on three games: one game jam, and two final projects of the Game Design program at VFS.
